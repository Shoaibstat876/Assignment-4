Readme.md: Joke Bot

🤖 01 - Joke Bot

📌 Problem Statement:

Create a simple bot that tells a joke if the user types Joke, otherwise it apologizes and ends.

✅ Steps:

Prompt the user using the message stored in PROMPT

Read and clean the input (strip and lowercase it)

If the input includes the word joke, respond with a stored joke

Else, print a polite sorry message

💡 Output Example:

What do you want? Joke
Here is a joke for you! Sophia is heading out to the grocery store. A programmer tells her: get a liter of milk, and if they have eggs, get 12. Sophia returns with 13 liters of milk. The programmer asks why and Sophia replies: 'because they had eggs'

What do you want? Hello
Sorry I only tell jokes.

👨‍💻 Developer Notes:

Used basic if-else for decision making

Lowercased and stripped the input for better matching

Demonstrates simple use of constants, string comparison, and basic interaction in Python
