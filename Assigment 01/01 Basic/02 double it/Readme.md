# 🌀 02 - Double It

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that asks a user to enter a number, then repeatedly doubles it and prints the result until the number is 100 or greater.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Prompt the user to enter a number
- Store it in a variable named `curr_value`
- Use a `while` loop to double the value repeatedly
- Stop when the value is 100 or more
- Print each result in every loop iteration

---

### 💡 Output Example:
Enter a number: 2
4
8
16
32
64
128


---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Practiced using a `while` loop for conditional repetition  
- Used `curr_value = curr_value * 2` to double the value  
- Ensured clean logic and break condition with `curr_value < 100`  
- User input handled using `int(input(...))`
