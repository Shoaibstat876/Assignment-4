# 🎯 03 - Guess My Number

### 📌 Problem Statement:
A fun guessing game! The program picks a number between 1 and 99. The user keeps guessing until they get it right. Each guess is met with a hint — too high or too low.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Generate a random number using `random.randint(1, 99)`
- Prompt the user for a guess
- Give hints if the guess is too high or too low
- Repeat until the correct number is guessed
- Celebrate with a congratulatory message 🎉

### 💡 Output Example:
I am thinking of a number between 1 and 99... Enter a guess: 50
Your guess is too high

Enter a new guess: 25
Your guess is too low

...

Congrats! The number was: 48

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Practiced using the `random` module  
- Used `while` loop for repetition and `if-else` for decision making  
- Wrapped logic inside `main()` function for good structure
