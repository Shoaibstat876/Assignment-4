# 🚀 04 - Lift Off

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program to simulate a spaceship countdown. The program should count down from 10 to 1 and then print "Liftoff!".

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Use a `for` loop to count backwards from 10 to 1
- Print each number one by one
- After the loop ends, print `Liftoff!`

### 💡 Output Example:
10
9
8
7

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Practiced using `range(start, stop, step)` to count down  
- Used `print()` for outputting countdown numbers and message  
- Ensured output matches real-world countdown feel
