## 🌍 Planetary Weight Calculator

This project helps calculate your weight on different planets based on the varying gravitational forces across the solar system. Python's input, float conversion, conditional logic, and rounding are used to build a space-themed calculator!

### 🔭 Features
- Calculates Mars weight from Earth weight (simple.py)
- Calculates weight on **all planets** in the solar system (extend.py)
- Uses constants for planetary gravity
- User input for both weight and planet

### 🚀 How It Works
- Earth weight is taken as input from the user
- In `simple.py`, this is multiplied by 0.378 to simulate Mars gravity
- In `extend.py`, users choose from planets like Jupiter or Venus and get weight calculated accordingly
- Results are rounded to **2 decimal places** using Python's `round()` function

### 📦 Files
- `simple.py`: Basic version calculating Mars weight only
- `extend.py`: Full-featured version for all planets
- `starter_code.md`: Initial boilerplate for students
- `solution.md`: Completed logic and explanation
- `handout.md`: Problem explanation and milestone breakdown
- `explanation.md`: Code walkthrough and logic mapping

### 🧪 Sample Output

### ✅ Skills Gained
- Working with user input
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Constants for cleaner and readable code
- Float math and formatting in Python
