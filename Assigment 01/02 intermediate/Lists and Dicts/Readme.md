Readme: Lists and Dicts Project
Welcome to the Lists and Dicts practice assignment!

This project is designed to help you solidify your Python skills related to list operations and index-based manipulation using two practical and fun problems:

ðŸ¥­ Problem 1: List Practice
ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Create a fruit list with 5 items

Print the number of items using len()

Append a new item ('mango')

Print the updated list

This problem is your introduction to list creation, measuring length, and appending new data â€” simple but essential for working with data collections.

ðŸ§© Problem 2: Index Game
ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Build an interactive program that allows the user to:

Access an item in a list by index

Modify an item at a specific index

Slice the list based on two indices

You'll write helper functions to:

Handle out-of-range errors

Modify values

Use slicing techniques safely

This game-like task builds real-world logic for working with lists and managing user input.

ðŸ“‚ Files Included:
main.py â€“ Your driver file

starter_code.md â€“ Skeleton for both problems

solution.md â€“ Full working solution

handout.md â€“ Project description and milestones

explanation.md â€“ Conceptual overview

readme.md â€“ This file!
