Explanation: Lists and Dicts Practice

This assignment is designed to help you deeply understand and apply Python list operations and control flow through two key problems:

âœ… Problem 1: List Practice

Goal:

To practice basic operations on lists:

Creating a list

Using the len() function

Adding a new item to a list using append()

Printing a list using a loop

Logic Breakdown:

Step

Operation Description

Function Used

Create List

Make a list of fruits

list literal [...]

Count Length

Count total items in the list

len(list)

Add an Item

Append "mango" to the end

append()

Print All Items

Print each item in the list

for loop

ðŸŽ® Problem 2: Index Game

Goal:

To help users:

Access items in a list by index

Modify a value in a list

Slice the list between two indices

Core Concepts:

Indexing

Slicing

Try-Except for IndexError handling

Function Breakdown:

Function

Purpose

access_element()

Returns an element at a given index or error message

modify_element()

Changes value at given index to a new one or returns error

slice_list()

Returns a sublist from start to end (exclusive)

index_game()

Main interactive function to let users select actions and manipulate list

ðŸ§  Why This Matters

Lists are foundational data structures in Python and most programming languages. Mastery of lists means you'll be better prepared to:

Work with data in loops

Modify and manage collections

Handle edge cases and errors effectively

By mixing static coding (Problem 1) with interactive gameplay (Problem 2), you gain confidence in both design and functionality.
