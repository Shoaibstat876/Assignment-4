# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe — Python Project

A classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built in Python for two human players. Simple, text-based, and great for practicing control flow, loops, and game logic!

## 🧠 How It Works

- Two players take turns playing on a 3x3 board.
- Each player places either `X` or `O` in an empty cell.
- The first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If the board fills up without a winner, the game is a tie.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Two-player mode (human vs human)
- ✅ Input validation and re-prompts
- ✅ Win condition checking
- ✅ Tie condition handling
- ✅ Option to play again after the match
