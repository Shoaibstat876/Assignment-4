# Binary Search Python Project 🔍

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Python.

## 🚀 How It Works
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed the possible locations to just one.

## 🧠 Features
- Uses a sorted list of numbers
- Accepts user input to find a number
- Efficient search with `O(log n)` complexity
- Clear console interaction with success/error feedback

## 📁 Files
- `main.py`: Contains the implementation and interaction logic

## 🔢 Sample List
```
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21]
```

## 📌 Example Run
```
Welcome to Binary Search Demo! 🔍
Sorted List: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21]
Enter a number to search: 15
✅ 15 found at index 7.
```

## 📚 Concepts Practiced
- Algorithm design
- While loops
- Conditionals
- Indexing

## 🧊 Tip
Make sure the list is sorted before running binary search, or the results will be unpredictable!

Happy searching! 🧠
