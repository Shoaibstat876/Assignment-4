# 🧾 07 - Get List

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that continuously asks the user to enter values, which are added one by one into a list.  
When the user presses **Enter** without typing anything, the program should **print the full list**.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Create an empty list called `lst`
- Prompt the user to enter values using `input()`  
- Continue asking until the user presses **Enter** without typing anything  
- Add each value to the list using `.append()`  
- Print the final list once input ends

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Enter a value: 1
Enter a value: 2
Enter a value: 3
Enter a value:
Here's the list: ['1', '2', '3']


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- User input in a loop using `while val:`  
- Storing values in a list  
- Detecting empty input to stop the loop  
- Printing a full list with `print(...)`

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- No need to convert input — all values are stored as strings  
- Great practice for working with lists, conditionals, and input/output  
- Demonstrates a flexible input pattern useful in many real-world tasks
