# 📦 06 - Get Last Elements

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a function that takes in a list and **prints the last element**.  
The list is built dynamically using user input and is guaranteed to be non-empty.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Prompt the user repeatedly to enter list elements  
- Store the elements in a list using a helper function `get_lst()`  
- Call `get_last_element(lst)` to print the **last element** using `lst[-1]` or `lst[len(lst) - 1]`

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. Red
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. Green
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. Blue
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Accessing the last element with `lst[-1]` is a Pythonic trick  
- Lists are **zero-indexed**, so the last element is at `len(lst) - 1`  
- Demonstrates simple **indexing** and **user-driven list building**

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Used a loop to build a dynamic list based on user input  
- Applied both traditional and Pythonic indexing methods  
- Reinforced list access techniques — perfect prep for data tasks ahead
