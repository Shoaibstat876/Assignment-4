# ➕ 01 - Add Many Numbers

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a function that takes a **list of numbers** and returns the **sum** of those numbers.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define a function `add_many_numbers(numbers)`  
- Initialize a variable `total_so_far = 0`  
- Loop through the list using a `for` loop  
- Add each number to the total  
- Return the final result  
- In `main()`, create a sample list and print the result

---

### 💡 Output Example:

15


(*Because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15*)

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Used a `for` loop to iterate through the list  
- Demonstrated how to pass a list as a function argument  
- Used manual summing logic instead of built-in `sum()` to show loop flow  
- Separated logic into a reusable function for clean structure
