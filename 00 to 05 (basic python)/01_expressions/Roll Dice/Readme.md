### 📌 Problem Statement:
Simulate rolling two 6-sided dice.  
Print the result of each individual die roll, as well as the total of both rolls combined.

### ✅ Steps:
- Define a constant: `NUM_SIDES = 6`
- Use `random.randint(1, NUM_SIDES)` to roll each die
- Store and print the values of both rolls
- Add the two values to get the total
- Display all results clearly

### 💡 Output Example:

Dice have 6 sides each.
First die: 4
Second die: 2
