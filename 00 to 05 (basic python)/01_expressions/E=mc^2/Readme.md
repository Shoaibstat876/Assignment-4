# ⚛️ 02 - E = mc² (Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence)

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that asks the user to input mass (in kilograms) and calculates the equivalent energy using Einstein's famous formula:

E = m × C²


Where:
- `E` is energy in joules  
- `m` is mass in kilograms  
- `C` is the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s)

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define constant `C = 299792458`
- Prompt the user to enter a value for `mass`
- Use the formula `energy = mass × C²`
- Print each value and final result step-by-step

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Enter kilos of mass: 100
e = m * C^2...
m = 100.0 kg
C = 299792458 m/s
8.987551787368176e+18 joules of energy!

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Used `float()` to allow decimal input for mass  
- Used `**` operator to square the speed of light  
- Output formatted clearly for readability  
- Demonstrates how math and constants are used in real physics equations
