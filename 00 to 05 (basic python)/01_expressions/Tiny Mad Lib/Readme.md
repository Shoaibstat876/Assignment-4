# ✍️ 08 - Tiny Mad Lib

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Create a mini **Mad Libs** word game that prompts the user for:
- an **adjective**
- a **noun**
- a **verb**

Then, insert the words into a fun and silly sentence template!

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define a sentence starter constant  
- Prompt the user for an adjective, noun, and verb  
- Use string concatenation to create a final sentence  
- Print the final story using the user's inputs

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Please type an adjective and press enter. tiny
Please type a noun and press enter. plant
Please type a verb and press enter. fly
Panaversity is fun. I learned to program and used Python to make my tiny plant fly!

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Used string variables to collect descriptive words  
- Defined `SENTENCE_START` to keep the sentence clean and reusable  
- Final sentence built with `+` string concatenation  
- Great exercise for practicing user input and string formatting
