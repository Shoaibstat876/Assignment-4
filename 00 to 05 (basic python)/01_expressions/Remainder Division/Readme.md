# ➗ 05 - Remainder Division

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that asks the user for two integers and then prints:
- The result of integer division  
- The remainder of the division

Formula:
quotient = dividend // divisor
remainder = dividend % divisor

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Ask user for `dividend` and `divisor`  
- Use integer division `//` to find the quotient  
- Use modulus `%` to find the remainder  
- Display the result clearly

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Please enter an integer to be divided: 5
Please enter an integer to divide by: 3
The result of this division is 1 with a remainder of 2

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Used `int()` to convert input into integers  
- Demonstrated integer division with `//` and modulo `%`  
- Output printed using `str()` and sentence formatting  
- Simple yet powerful use of Python’s arithmetic operators
