# 🎢 04 - Tall Enough to Ride

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that asks the user **how tall they are**, and tells them whether they’re **tall enough to ride** a rollercoaster.

In this program, the **minimum height requirement** is set to **50 units**.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define a constant `MINIMUM_HEIGHT = 50`  
- Ask the user for their height using `input()`  
- Convert the input to a number using `float()`  
- Use an `if-else` statement to compare the user’s height with the minimum  
- Print a friendly message depending on the result

---

### 💡 Output Examples:

How tall are you? 100
You're tall enough to ride!


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Use of **constants** to store rule-based values  
- **Conditional logic (`if-else`)** to evaluate eligibility  
- Clean separation of logic and output for easy readability

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Used `float()` to support decimal inputs like 49.9 or 50.5  
- Easy to extend for loops or retries (bonus: add a while-loop!)  
- Simple logic, but great for practicing **threshold-based decisions**
