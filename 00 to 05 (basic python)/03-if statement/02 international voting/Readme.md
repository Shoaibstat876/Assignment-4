# 🗳️ 02 - International Voting

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that asks the user for their **age** and checks whether they are eligible to vote in three fictional countries, based on each country's voting age:

- **Peturksbouipo**: voting age is **16**  
- **Stanlau**: voting age is **25**  
- **Mayengua**: voting age is **48**

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Ask the user: `"How old are you?"`  
- Check if the user is old enough to vote in each country using conditional statements (`if`)  
- Print a custom message for **each country** based on eligibility

---

### 💡 Output Example:

How old are you? 20
You can vote in Peturksbouipo where the voting age is 16.
You cannot vote in Stanlau where the voting age is 25.
You cannot vote in Mayengua where the voting age is 48.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Use of **constants** for voting age values  
- Simple `if-else` conditionals to compare values  
- Clear and personalized output based on user input

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Used `int()` to convert input to a numeric value  
- Followed clean code conventions using constants (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)  
- This task is a great introduction to **multi-branch decision-making**
