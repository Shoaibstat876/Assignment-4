# 🎲 05 - Random Numbers

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that prints **10 random numbers** in the range **1 to 100**, all on the same line.

Each time the program runs, it should produce a **different sequence** of numbers.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Use the `random.randint()` function to generate numbers between **1** and **100** (inclusive)  
- Repeat the process using a loop to generate **10 numbers**  
- Print all numbers on a single line separated by spaces

---

### 💡 Output Examples:
45 79 61 47 52 10 16 83 19 12

81 76 70 1 27 63 96 100 32 92


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- `random.randint(a, b)` returns a number **between a and b**, including both  
- Use of `for _ in range(10)` to repeat a process exactly 10 times  
- Use of `print(..., end=" ")` to avoid line breaks

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Constants like `N_NUMBERS`, `MIN_VALUE`, and `MAX_VALUE` make the code easy to tweak  
- This is a great exercise in **loops**, **libraries**, and **randomness**  
- Every run feels new — like rolling real dice!
