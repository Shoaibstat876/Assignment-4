# 🍍 03 - Fruit Inventory Checker

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Sophia has a fruit store. She wants to let customers check how many of a certain fruit she has in stock.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Prompt the user for a fruit name using `input()`
- Pass that fruit name to a helper function `num_in_stock()`
- If the result is 0 → print "This fruit is not in stock."
- If the result is greater than 0 → print the amount available

---

### 💡 Sample Output:

Enter a fruit: pear This fruit is in stock! Here is how many: 1000 

SECOND EXAMPLE:
Enter a fruit: lychee This fruit is not in stock.


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Conditional statements (`if`/`else`)
- Function creation and usage
- Simple inventory simulation using `if`-based lookup

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Could be enhanced in the future using dictionaries
- Case sensitivity is currently strict (e.g., `Pear` will return 0)
