# 🎯 02 - In Range Checker

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a function `in_range(n, low, high)` that checks whether a number is within a given range (inclusive). Return `True` if it is, otherwise `False`.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Prompt user for a number (`n`) and range (`low`, `high`)
- Implement `in_range(n, low, high)` to compare `n` with `low` and `high`
- Print whether the number falls within the range

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Enter a number to check: 8 Enter the lower bound: 5 Enter the upper bound: 10 8 is within the range 5 to 10.


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Conditional checks using logical AND (`and`)
- Boolean return values
- Function reusability and clarity

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Test the function with edge cases like `n == low` and `n == high`
- You can reuse this function in games, filters, or validations
