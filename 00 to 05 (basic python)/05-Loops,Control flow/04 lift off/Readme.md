# 🚀 04 - Lift Off

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a countdown program for a spaceship launch!  
Start counting down from **10 to 1**, then display **"Liftoff!"** at the end.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Use a `for` loop with `range(10, 0, -1)` to count backward from 10 to 1  
- Print each number on the **same line** using `end=" "`  
- After the loop ends, print `"Liftoff!"` 🎉

---

### 💡 Output Example:

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Liftoff!


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- `range(start, stop, step)` used for reverse looping  
- `end=" "` keeps output on one line  
- Print outside the loop to signal final liftoff

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- This program demonstrates **loop control with direction**  
- Can be easily customized (e.g. starting from 5 or adding delays)  
- A simple yet powerful example of how loops can control output sequences
