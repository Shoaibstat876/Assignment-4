# ✨ 02 - Print Events

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that prints the **first 20 even numbers** starting from 0.  
Instead of writing 20 separate print statements, use a **loop** to generate the sequence.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Use a `for` loop with `range(20)` to repeat the logic 20 times  
- Multiply each loop index by 2 to generate even numbers  
- Print all numbers **on the same line** for clean output

---

### 💡 Output Example:

0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- `range(20)` generates 20 iterations from `0` to `19`  
- Multiplying each index by `2` yields even numbers  
- `print(..., end=" ")` prints all results on one line

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Code is concise, readable, and efficient  
- Great example of **looping logic + arithmetic**  
- Can be extended easily (e.g. print 50 even numbers, or use `while` instead)
