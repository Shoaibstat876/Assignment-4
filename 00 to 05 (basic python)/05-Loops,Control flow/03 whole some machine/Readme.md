# 🍽️ 03 - Whole Some Machine

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Create a **positive affirmation machine** using a `while` loop.  
This program keeps asking the user to type a powerful affirmation until they get it exactly right.

It helps build a growth mindset and reinforce strength through repetition 💪

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define an `AFFIRMATION` string constant  
- Ask the user to **type the affirmation**  
- Use a `while` loop to **keep prompting** the user until they match the affirmation exactly  
- Once correct, display a motivational message 💖

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Please type the following affirmation: I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to.
I am strong.
That was not the affirmation.
Please type the following affirmation: I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to.
I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to.
That's right! :)
