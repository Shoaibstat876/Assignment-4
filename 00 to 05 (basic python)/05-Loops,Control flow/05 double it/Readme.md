# 🌀 05 - Double It

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a program that **repeatedly doubles a number** until the result is **100 or more**.

For example, if the user enters `2`, the program should print:
4 8 16 32 64 128

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Ask the user for a number (`curr_value`)  
- While `curr_value < 100`, double it and print the new value  
- Output all values on the **same line** using `end=" "` for clean formatting

---

### 💡 Output Example:

**User input:**
Enter a number to start doubling: 3

**Program output:**
6 12 24 48 96 192

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- `while` loop for repeated execution  
- `curr_value = curr_value * 2` to double the number  
- Loop continues until value reaches 100 or more  
- Neat inline output using `print(..., end=" ")`

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- A great intro to **while loops** and arithmetic updates  
- Can be modified to track how many times it doubled  
- Encourages thinking in terms of **loop conditions + updates**
