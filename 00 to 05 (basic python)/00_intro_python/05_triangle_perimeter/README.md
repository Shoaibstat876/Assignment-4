# 📐 05 - Triangle Perimeter

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Prompt the user to enter the lengths of all three sides of a triangle.  
Then calculate and display the perimeter (sum of all sides).

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Prompt the user to enter `side1`, `side2`, and `side3` (decimal values allowed)
- Convert the inputs to `float` for precision
- Add all three sides to get the `perimeter`
- Display the result clearly

---

### 💡 Output Example:

What is the length of side 1? 3
What is the length of side 2? 4
What is the length of side 3? 5.5
The perimeter of the triangle is 12.5

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Practiced using `float()` to handle decimal inputs  
- Calculated sum using simple arithmetic  
- Printed output using `str()` for clean formatting  
- All logic structured inside the `main()` function
