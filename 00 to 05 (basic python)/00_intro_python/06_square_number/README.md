# 🟦 06 - Square a Number

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Ask the user for a number and print its square (i.e., the number multiplied by itself).

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Prompt the user to enter a number
- Convert the input to a float (for decimal support)
- Use the `**` operator or multiply the number by itself
- Display the result in a readable format

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Type a number to see its square: 4
4.0 squared is 16.0


---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Used `float()` to support decimal input  
- Calculated square using `num ** 2` (exponentiation)  
- Used `str()` to convert numbers for string concatenation  
- Wrapped everything inside `main()` for clarity and structure
