# 🔢 06 - Is Odd

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a function called `is_odd()` that checks if a number is odd.  
Then loop through the numbers from **10 to 19** and print whether each is "even" or "odd".

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define `is_odd(value)` to return `True` if `value % 2 == 1`  
- Loop through `range(10, 20)` in `main()`  
- For each number:
  - Print `"even"` if the number is divisible by 2
  - Print `"odd"` otherwise

---

### 💡 Output Example:

10 even
11 odd
12 even
13 odd
14 even
15 odd
16 even
17 odd
18 even
19 odd


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- **Modulus operator** (`%`) to detect even/odd  
- **Custom function** (`is_odd`) to improve readability and reuse  
- Looping with `range(start, end)`  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- This task strengthens your use of **Boolean logic + conditionals**  
- You can extend this to filter even/odd numbers from user-generated lists!  
- Clean, readable, and a great foundation for more advanced logic checks
