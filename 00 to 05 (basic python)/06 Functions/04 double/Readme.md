# 🔁 04 - Double

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a **function** `double(num)` that takes a number as input and returns **twice its value**.

The main program will:
- Prompt the user for a number  
- Pass that number into `double()`  
- Print the result in a friendly message

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define `double(num)` to return `num * 2`  
- Use `input()` to take a number from the user  
- Convert the input to an integer using `int()`  
- Call `double(num)` and store result  
- Print: `"Double that is <result>"`

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Enter a number: 2 Double that is 4


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Function creation and reuse  
- User input via `input()`  
- Typecasting using `int()`  
- Simple arithmetic operations (`*` multiplication)

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Great example of **function modularity + input/output**  
- Try extending it to triple, square, or halve a number for more practice  
- Very beginner-friendly way to introduce function-return values
