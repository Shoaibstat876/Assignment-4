# 🎯 08 - Print Multiple

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Create a function `print_multiple(message, repeats)` that prints a given message multiple times.  
The number of times to repeat the message is based on user input.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Prompt the user to enter a **message** (string)  
- Prompt the user to enter **how many times** to print it (integer)  
- Call `print_multiple(message, repeats)` to handle the logic  
- Use a `for` loop inside the function to print the message repeatedly

---

### 💡 Output Example:

Please type a message: Hello! Enter a number of times to repeat your message: 4 Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Functions with parameters  
- User input with `input()` and `int()` conversion  
- Repeating actions using `for i in range(...)`  
- Separation of logic (`main()` handles input, function handles printing)

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Try modifying it to print the **index alongside the message** (e.g., "1. Hello!")  
- Great warm-up for working with **loops, strings, and parameters** in combination  
- You can reuse this pattern in future UI prompts or CLI programs
