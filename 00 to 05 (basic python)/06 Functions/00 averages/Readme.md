# 📊 00 - Averages

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Write a **function** that takes two numbers as input and returns the **average** (midpoint) between them.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define a function `average(a, b)`  
- Inside the function, calculate `(a + b) / 2`  
- Call the function multiple times:
  - To get `avg_1` from 0 and 10  
  - To get `avg_2` from 8 and 10  
  - Then find the final average between `avg_1` and `avg_2`

---

### 💡 Output Example:

avg_1 5.0 avg_2 9.0 final 7.0


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Function creation and reuse  
- Clean separation of logic from the main flow  
- Mathematical average: `(a + b) / 2`  
- Code readability and modularity using named functions

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- Excellent intro to **Python functions**  
- Function is **pure** (no side effects) and reusable  
- Can be extended to average more than two numbers later!
