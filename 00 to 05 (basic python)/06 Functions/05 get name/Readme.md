# 📛 05 - Get Name

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Fill out a function called `get_name()` that returns a **hardcoded name** (`"Sophia"`).  
The program then prints a friendly greeting using that name.

---

### ✅ Steps:
- Define the function `get_name()`  
- Inside it, return the string `"Sophia"`  
- In `main()`, call `get_name()` and store its result in a variable called `name`  
- Print: `"Howdy <name> ! 🤠"`

### 💡 Output Example:


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Function definition and return  
- Returning a **string** value  
- Reusing function output inside `main()`  
- String formatting in `print()`

---

### 👨‍💻 Developer Notes:
- This is a simple but important practice of **function return values**  
- Try customizing it by returning your own name (e.g., `"Shoaib"` 😉)  
- Could be expanded into dynamic greetings, nicknames, or input-based intros
